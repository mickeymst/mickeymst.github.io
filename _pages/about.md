## About me

Hello, I'm __Michiharu Yamashita__. [\[CV\]](https://mickeymst.github.io/files/CV_latest.pdf)

I am a second year PhD student at [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) surpervised by [Prof. Dongwon Lee](http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/). Prior to Penn State, I received M.Eng. in Computational Intelligence and Systems Science at Tokyo Institute of Technology, and B.S. in Management Science and Engineering at University of Tsukuba. I worked as a research engineer and machine learning engineer for three years after I obtained M.Eng. 

My research interest is in computational jobs marketplace and machine learning. I'm especially working on 1) how we can solve practical problems using the real-world jobs marketplace dataset, 2) how we can build a user-oriented career pathway models and understand company and talent behavior, and 3) how we can make a robust and secure models in computational jobs marketplace.
