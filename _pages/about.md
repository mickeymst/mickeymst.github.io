## About me

Hello, my name is __Michiharu Yamashita__. [\[CV\]](https://mickeymst.github.io/files/CV_latest.pdf)

I received my Master's degree of Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology, where I majored in [Computational Intelligence and Systems Science](http://www.igs.titech.ac.jp/english/departments/dis.html) and my Bachelor's degree of Engineering from University of Tsukuba, where I studied [Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/College/english/major/management.html). I also have two years work experience as a research scientist and machine learning engineer in [Recruit Holdings](https://recruit-holdings.com/) that is the *only* Japanese company in the top 15 global internet companies by market capitalization according to [the 2019 internet trends report by Mary Meeker](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/internet-trends-report-2019/?fbclid=IwAR0szWSP8bxDy1pu3lwQxJz5aGJOeDg8aId1kSqTWg6WcFGe0RJPSlNBu6M). My main area of research is in Computational Social Science. I am interested in detecting human's preference, relationship, happiness, and behavior patterns. I also have focused on various types of data like webpage, social media, wearable sensors, and GPS based location. Currently, I am looking for available positions to resume my education in the Ph.D. program.
