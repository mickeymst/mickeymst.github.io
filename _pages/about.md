## About me

Hello, my name is __Michiharu Yamashita__. [\[CV\]](https://mickeymst.github.io/files/CV_latest.pdf)

I received Master of Engineering in [Computational Intelligence and Systems Science](http://www.igs.titech.ac.jp/english/departments/dis.html) from Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Bachelor of Science in [Management Science and Engineering](https://www.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/College/english/major/management.html) from University of Tsukuba. I also have two years work experience as a research scientist and machine learning engineer in [Recruit Holdings](https://recruit-holdings.com/) that is the *only* Japanese company in the top 15 global internet companies by market capitalization. My main area of research is in Computational Social Science. I am interested in detecting human's preference, relationship, happiness, and behavior patterns. I also have focused on various types of data like webpage, social media, wearable sensors, and GPS based location. Currently, I am looking for available positions to resume my education in the Ph.D. program.
