## About me

Hello, I'm __Michiharu Yamashita__. [\[CV\]](https://mickeymst.github.io/files/CV_latest.pdf)

I am a PhD candidate at [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/), [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) surpervised by [Prof. Dongwon Lee](http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/).  

My research interest is in NLP, Graph, and ML applications on online job platforms. I am especially working on 1) how we can solve practical problems on real-world job marketplace datasets, 2) how we can develop user-oriented career recommendation models, and 3) how we can make robust and secure models in computational job marketplaces. 
As side work, I am also delving into the capabilities of LLMs in various contexts. My current endeavors include exploring multilingual AI-human text detection and misinformation detection.
