excerpt: "BigGorilla is open-source components for data integration and preparation, which began in September 2016 jointly by the Recruit and University of Wisconsin at Madison. In various steps of data science, scientists spend over 80% of time for pre-processing data. BigGorilla documents existing technologies and our original technologies to solve the problem. I evangelized it and applied these technologies into 12 groups across 8 companies within Recruit to show that BigGorilla is effective across the company's diverse range of businesses: the extraction of store names (or person names and location information) from unstructured data and web pages, the de-duplication of multiple variants of store names (or company names, property names), the conversion of medical prescription data and merging of lists from multiple data sources. For example, with BigGorilla, we obtained 98.9% accuracy on the task of de-duplicating approximately 10,000 store names (Here is [the press release](https://recruit-holdings.com/news_data/release/2017/0630_7890.html) at that time).
