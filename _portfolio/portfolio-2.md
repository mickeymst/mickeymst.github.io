title: "Spysee2"
excerpt: "Spysee2 is one of the biggest Japanese search engine of people and their relationship on the web. I extracted a person's social network from the web using heuristic techniques and developed contemporary machine learning and NLP based algorithms for the extraction of various types of information about people (bio-data, profile picture, social network, related web pages etc.) from unstructured and noisy web data. I also developed a solution for name disambiguation problems in short texts using a probabilistic classifier.
